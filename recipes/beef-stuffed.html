    <h1>Beef-Stuffed Mushrooms</h1>
    <img src="./recipes/src/Beef-Stuffed Mushrooms" alt="beef-stuffed-mushrooms">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is an 18th-century beef-stuffed mushroom recipe that I have altered slightly. Better make a double batch because these go fast. Sausage can be substituted for ground beef.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced onion</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup bread crumbs</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Step 2: Remove and chop mushroom stems.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Combine ground beef, onion, and garlic in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook until beef is no longer pink; drain. Mix in chopped mushroom stems, 1 tablespoon butter, bread crumbs, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in cream.</li>
        <li>Step 4: Dip mushroom caps in 1/4 cup melted butter and stuff generously with meat mixture. Arrange stuffed mushrooms in a baking dish. Sprinkle with chili powder.</li>
        <li>Step 5: Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
