        <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oilve oil</li>
        <li>½ medium onion, diced</li>
        <li>8 ounces baby bella mushrooms, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>freshly cracked salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
        <li>2 ounces Gruyère cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray cups of two 12-cup mini muffin pans with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until the edges of the onion begin to brown and caramelize, about 3 minutes. Add mushrooms and garlic, and cook until mushrooms are soft. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer vegetables to a paper towel-lined plate with a slotted spoon.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Roll out puff pastry sheet into a horizontal rectangle on a large, lightly floured cutting board. Use a pizza slicer to cut pastry into 4 rows horizontally and 6 rows vertically so that you have 24 (2 ½-inch) squares. Press each dough square into each mini muffin cup and prick with the tines of a fork.</li>
        <li>Step 4: Divide mushroom mixture amongst pastry cups. Top with shredded Gruyère and Parmesan cheeses. Sprinkle with thyme.</li>
        <li>Step 5: Bake in the preheated oven until the pastry is puffed up and the corners are golden brown, about 15 minutes. Briefly cool in the pans on a wire rack before transferring the bites to a serving dish. Serve warm. </li>
